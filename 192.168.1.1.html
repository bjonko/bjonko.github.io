<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h1&gt;Producing internet security!&lt;/h1&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h2 style="color: #2e6c80;"&gt;How to use the editor:&lt;/h2&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;In light of the destructive capacity of contemporary cyber attacks exemplified by the Estonian 2007 incident and the Conficker botnet, how has the Internet survived without a comprehensive technological and organisational security infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;A complete answer will be provided in Chapter 6. In this chapter, the ground will be prepared for directly addressing this question by way of recounting how communities and teams of technical security experts did in fact respond in the two cases mentioned. These teams in responding to the attacks demonstrated considerable ingenuity, creating products and services that will also be of interest. The role of peer-production in Internet security can only be gauged by a review of the solutions that have been produced.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;For each of the two cases there is a distinct section in this chapter. In these sections, a detailed narrative of the response activities is provided. If necessary, technical background information is amended to help to understand the response strategy chosen by the actors responding to the incidents. The analysis is in addition supplemented by a description of the organisational approach of the response activities for &lt;a href="http://19216811.help/" target="_blank"&gt;192.168.1.1&lt;/a&gt;. Each case is addressed separately in this chapter, so that a detailed account can be presented of all pertinent response activities.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Some attempt has been made to avoid highly technical jargon to facilitate comprehension. All response activities will be set in the context of the overriding organizational approach.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Estonia&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;How did Estonia respond to what has been called &amp;ldquo;the first attack of its kind, directed&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;against virtually the entire informational infrastructure of a NATO country&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;(Clover 2009) This question has not been sufficiently studied. Our knowledge&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;is largely based on brief presentations by a very small number of technical experts,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;who were either personally involved in the response activities or one remove from&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;those actually involved (Kaeo 2007; Aarelaid 2007; Kash 2008; Randel 2008).&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Written from a legal perspective, the most inclusive study on the Estonian events&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;so far by Tikk et al. remains rather tight-lipped on incident response on the operational&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;level (2010). The account does not say much more than that the response&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&amp;ldquo;was coordinated by CERT-EE with the help of system administrators and experts&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;both within and outside of the country&amp;rdquo; (2010, p. 24). The Evron analyses benefit&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;somewhat from data gathered at ground zero but, unfortunately, at a time when&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;the bulk of cyber attacks were over. (Evron &amp;amp; Aarelaid, 2008; Evron 2008b). More&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;recently, Jaan Priisalu, now head of the Estonian RIA, has enriched the debate and&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;shared his impressions of the events in a public discussion (Gomez 2012).&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;The following sections give a description of the actors involved in incident response,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;their actions, and their resources to re-establish the security of Estonian&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Internet services.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Emergence of the Estonian community&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;The attacks did not come as a surprise to the Estonian security community. Estonia&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;informal yet tightly knit community was on alert. &amp;ldquo;When there are riots in the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;streets, they will eventually go cyber&amp;rdquo;, was an assessment shared by many in the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Estonian security community. But they expected an attack only for late May 8 or&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;May 9, Estonia&amp;rsquo;s contested historical date. In the last week of April 2007, the head&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;of CERT EE, Hillar Aarelaid, was even attending a cyber forensics course at the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Templemore college of An Garda S&amp;iacute;och&amp;aacute;na, Ireland&amp;rsquo;s national police. The Garda&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Computer Crime unit then led an EU-sponsored Falcone project to establish a&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;European platform for cyber investigation training.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The expectation of some sort of cyber attack was not based on intuition alone. In&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;mid-April the message was spreading within the Estonian and wider international&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Internet security communities that on Russian-language forums commenters were&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;calling to low-intensity cyber-arms, trying to find comrades who would help to&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;initiate DDoS attacks against organizational pillars of the Estonian society.&lt;span class="s1"&gt;74&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Estonia had a well connected and prepared national ICT security community in&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;place by the time the attacks commenced. As early as the late 1990s, banks began&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;collaborating and exchanging information on cyberattacks. At first, Information&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;System Security Officers (ISSOs) of at several banks cooperated, thereby violating&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;regulations that outlawed the exchange of information between banks. Banks had a&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;strong incentive for this kind of cooperation. They confronted a public that was&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;not yet convinced about the usefulness and security of online banking (Interview&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;83). The ISSOs got a green light from their superiors to collaborate with their&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;peers at other banks. Later on, executive levels tolerated and the parliament legalised&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;this species of collaboration among banks&amp;rsquo; ICT security staff. It was obvious to&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;the security experts that collaboration was absolutely necessary and that it would&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;have to include banks as well as suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;As such, it was crucial to recruit security experts from all manner of economic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;In the early 2000s, bank information security personnel teamed with peers&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;from ISPs, telcos, energy and other major companies. By 2003, an informal group&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;to protect the national critical information infrastructure had emerged. This group&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;of ISSOs also lobbied for the creation of a national CERT to ease cooperation and&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;information exchange.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Before long, the Estonian informal ICT security group allied itself with the traditional&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The development of a community of Estonian ICT security experts was facilitated&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;by the introduction of the Estonian ID card with cryptographic functionalities&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;built in and the introduction of Internet-based voting. With the advent of Internet-&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;based voting and the i-Elections of 2004, a task force of security experts from&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;ISPs, election authorities, police, intelligence services and others was put in place&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;to prepare for cyber interference in the electoral process.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Hackers around the world delighted in identifying and exploiting the vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;of electronic voting systems and this had damaged the emerging cyber-voting&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;business sector. But making matters even worse, a member of the Estonian Internet&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;voting project went public that Estonia's voting system was only as secure as&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;the PCs of its users (Sietmann 2005). The task force attempted to counter vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;via continuous monitoring in real time of the Internet. No major incidents&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;have been reported for one of these elections to this date according to local experts.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;After its establishing, the Estonian CERT (CERT-EE) has acted as the lead organisation&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;for election-related incidents and their prevention. CERT-EE was established&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;in January 2006 as a department inside RIA, the national office for&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;information systems.&lt;span class="s1"&gt;75 &lt;/span&gt;Elections for the national parliament were held March 4,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;2007, and again the election task force, which continued to exist next to and supplemented&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;by CERT-EE, met. With the onset of DDoS attacks seven weeks later&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;in late April, one observer noticed, &amp;ldquo;it was quite easy to get people together again&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;(Interview 87). The Estonians were prepared and had trained well. They understood&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;the demands of communication between teams and how to divide labors&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;(e.g. forum monitoring, supervision of firewalls, the oversight of suspicious web&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;fora). But they had never faced such a broad attack.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Team formation and first responses&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;A good month after the national election was held without major technical security&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;issues, the informal Estonian community was on alert, again. It thought May 8 the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;most likely date for a spill over of the offsite riots to the digital sphere: &amp;ldquo;We had&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;everything ready.&amp;rdquo; (Interview 87) Persons close to the Ministers of Defense and&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Interior were informed about possible DDoS attacks. Estonian intelligence was&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;likewise informed &amp;mdash; it is part of the Estonian Internet security information exchange&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;system. Despite the lack of a central availability monitoring of national&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Internet services, it soon became obvious to technical operators in Estonia that the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;websites of a number of local institutions had fallen victim to DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Four hours after the attacks had commenced, by 2 a.m. in the early morning of&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Friday, April 27, operational teams responsible for governmental servers had realized&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;in mutual updates by telephone that some government websites were exposed&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;to Internet traffic exceeding normal traffic by 100 to 1000 times. Servers could not&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;cope with the enormous traffic, hence, operational teams decided to move websites&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;to &amp;ldquo;well-defended&amp;rdquo; web servers scaled to handle the excessive traffic (Evron &amp;amp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Aarelaid, 2008). What had started as an operational IT security issue &amp;mdash; after all,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;DDoS attacks are almost daily business &amp;mdash; turned into a national security situation&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;three hours later when the chief public relations person of the Estonian defense&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;ministry stated around 1 a.m. on April 28, &amp;ldquo;We are under cyberattack.&amp;rdquo; (Kash&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;2008) In the words of his superior, the Estonian Minster of Defence, Jaak Aaviksso,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It turned out to be a national security situation.&amp;rdquo; (Cited by: Landler &amp;amp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Markoff, 2007)&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;This &amp;ldquo;security situation&amp;rdquo; was subsequently mitigated by the Estonian community of&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;technical experts with, in the beginning, mild support from their international&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;peers. When the attacks commenced, CERT-EE naturally evolved as the central&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;hub for information exchange and coordinated some of the defensive measures of&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;operational IT units in Estonian organizations. According to Lauri Almann, Estonia&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;then Permanent Undersecretary of Defence, &amp;ldquo;we put together a team of experts&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;from our departments of commerce, communications, military and the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;intelligence community, led by Estonian CERT&amp;rdquo; (Kash 2008). The actual response&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;community however was much larger and included Estonian and foreign actors,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;such as:&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;A key role in the technical response activities certainly had the Estonian CERT,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;the Estonian technical security community and the global Internet security community.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;76&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Collaboration with domestic actors was eased not only by previous collaboration,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;but also by Estonia&amp;rsquo;s unique situation. In a country with 1.4 million inhabitants&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;and a good 400,000 of them gathered in the capital Tallinn, geographic proximity&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;and naturally close social ties facilitate defensive ad-hoc collaboration. In the words&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;of Evron and Aarelaid: &amp;ldquo;Anyone can get in a car and drag people out of bed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;(Evron &amp;amp; Aarelaid, 2008) The nordic sauna culture played a supportive role, too.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;While Nokia's then newly crowned CEO Stephen Elop had identified it as a factor&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;that led to the demise of Nokia (Johnson 2011) before the mobile behemoth eventually&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;tanked under his leadership, an institutionalised mix of booze, sweat, and&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;nudity came to the rescue for Estonia. Meeting with their peers in hour-long gatherings&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;with alternating sauna and beer sessions, dubbed as the &amp;ldquo;beer &amp;amp; sauna protocol,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;has created a level of trust among Estonian experts that allowed them to&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;collaborate seamlessly during the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;DDoS mitigation&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Initially, the Estonian Internet security community took the incoming attacks as a&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;series of distinct smaller attacks. Defacement of the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s website (&amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;a dick&amp;rdquo;), spamming of Parliament&amp;rsquo;s web services, a DDoS attack on the Ministry of&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Defence &amp;mdash; all these incidents were handled case-by-case (Interview 87). As isolated&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;incidents, such attacks on organisational Internet systems were and are rather&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;ordinary. Dealing with them is everyday business, the response to them not very&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;challenging. But the number of such distinct incidents and their duration grew.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;There were too many such incidents at Estonian organisations. The goals of the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;response effort &amp;mdash; ensuring that all systems were up and running, delivering their&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;usual range of services, and keeping downtimes as limited as possible &amp;mdash; were&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;unachievable. Almost two days into the attacks, the response strategy was adapted&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;to meet the means available:&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&amp;ldquo;First, do not handle it case-by-case anymore. Second, go to sleep.&amp;rdquo; (Interview&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;87)&lt;span class="s1"&gt;77&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;The choice of the adequate response strategy is constrained by the technical nature&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;of the attacks, and the technical and organisational capabilities of the response side.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;There are two fundamental types of Denial-of-Service attacks: overstretching the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;capacity of a system by sheer amount of data or requests or, in a more qualitative&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;approach, by designing requests in a way that the attacked system needs to spend&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;many CPU cycles on the task. Responding to each requires a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;The scale of an attack is another factor to be considered for the response approach.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Upscaling systems is an intuitive response to quantitative DDoS attacks. Another&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;approach is to reduce the quality of one&amp;rsquo;s services, so that a service is still delivered&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;to many, albeit in a reduced quality. Stripping down a website and replacing it with&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;a minimalistic version is an example of such an approach.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The filtering can happen at any point&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;between attackers and the attacked. With an increase of the scale of an attack, it is&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;necessary to move the point of filtering further away from the attacked systems.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;And the scale of the attacks on Estonian systems increased.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Estonian organisations implemented a range of proven anti-DDoS measures, for it&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;was not the first large-scale DDoS attack they had had to confront. Larger organisations&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;like banks have the equipment and knowledge to handle smaller DDoS&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;attacks (Interview 64). All they need to do in such cases is to reconfigure their systems,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;e.g., by adding new filters. Some also had dedicated anti-DDoS devices installed&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;at perimeters of their networks. Intrusion detection and prevention systems&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;help to detect malicious packets designed to overstretch the capacities of their network&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;components and web systems (Interview 64). Even when bank systems came&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;to a halt, the response was dry:&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;We simply started to filter it&amp;hellip; It was quite boring actually, they rebooted,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;they reconfigured the machines.&amp;rdquo; (Interview 83)&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;But filtering on the organisational level was not sufficient to ensure the continuity&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;of their IT operations. Entangled in a &amp;ldquo;kind of a war mode&amp;rdquo;, one of the banks decided&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;to focus only on their most valuable customers.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;And the trick is, while we do this filtering, we don't have to communicate&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;with everybody on the Internet. There is no point. You have to&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;communicate just with the customer, with the people that you have&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;something to do with. Most important customers have account managers.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;So you know where they are, you'll do your filters accordingly.&amp;rdquo; (Interview&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;83)&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Reconfiguration does not always do the job. New iron was also added to Estonian&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;networks. Preparing for the expected onslaught on late May 8, a 10 Gbps cluster&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;was set up to support ICT services for governmental systems. This effort, led and&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;implemented by CERT EE, was supported by network equipment manufacturers&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;that voluntarily lent their hardware in non-office hours despite the absence of contractual&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;agreements or service level agreements that would have required such&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;prompt support (Interview 87).&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Eventually, the primary line of defence had to be moved away from the IT departments&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;of affected organisations. Filtering inbound traffic at Estonia&amp;rsquo;s upstream&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;providers was a more viable path. The basic strategy in a DDoS attack is to stop&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;malicious packets already at upstream providers.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;For such an approach, collaboration with first Estonian and then international&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;network providers was inevitable. Upstream providers needed addresses of Estonian&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;targets, analysed the traffic going through their networks to target addresses.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;When they see indications of malicious intent, they &amp;ldquo;try to limit that, &amp;hellip;try to clean&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;the traffic&amp;rdquo;, or establish a threshold for maximum traffic &amp;ldquo;just to give some breathing&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;space&amp;rdquo; for the affected Estonian sites (Interview 65). Estonian ISPs tried to&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;create such &amp;ldquo;breathing space&amp;rdquo; partly by blocking any traffic from abroad going to&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;web services that were being attacked. While this nurtured the impression among&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;foreign observers that an entire country was brought down, Estonian could still&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;enjoy services that were mostly directed at them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;A more sophisticated technique than bulk-blocking of inbound foreign traffic is to&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;find precise patterns by which attacking packets can be distinguished from normal&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;packets. Network providers could then identify and drop such packets into whichever&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;segment of the Internet between two communicating ends in which they occur.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Distributing such attack descriptions up to the traffic chain is in the best&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;economic interest of all providers, the networks of which are used to conveying&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;large amounts of malicious traffic to the target address. Network expert Bill&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Woodcock elaborates:&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;But as your service provider, [the bad traffic is] still consuming resources&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;in my network, it's coming to me and I throw it away. You are&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;not paying any extra for that. So I take that attack description and send&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;it to each of my peers [i.e., network providers with which the service&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;provider has a peering agreement; AS] who are sending me that traffic&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;because they are also not getting paid for the attack traffic, so it's in&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;their best interest to filter that traffic. &amp;hellip; It's usually not coming from a&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;single source, but from a botnet. But you usually don't go all the way&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;back to each source, at that point it's so diffuse that it doesn't make&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;sense anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Identifying the difference between good and bad packets is a clear technological&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I'm your ISP, I just notice more packets. I can't tell whether you had&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;a successful ad campaign or whether this is an attacker. &amp;hellip; You need to&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;define the difference between a normal packet and an attack packet.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;This is where a capable CERT can come to the rescue as they might be in a better&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;position to identify these bad packets (Interview 23). Increasingly though, vendors&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;of network devices provide solutions that can fulfil this task.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Heavy DDoS attacks are usually delivered by botnets. The Estonian attacks were&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;no different. There were some attempts to understand the botnets involved in the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;attacks. As a strategy against a DDoS attack however, disrupting a botnet is not a&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;feasible approach for an ongoing attack. Once a botnet has some degree of malicious&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;sophistication, the time span it takes to understand the intricacies of the botnet&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;malware, let alone to implement a proper mitigation strategy, is way too long&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;to be a viable anti-DDoS approach. Furthermore, anti-botnet research was in its&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;infancy in 2007. Continuous tracking of botnets was only started after the Estonian&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;incidents by the likes of Shadowserver, Arbor Networks or Team Cymru (Interview&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;84). Consequentially, it is not known how many and which botnets were used&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;for the attacks (Interview 84).&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;While this study focuses on the responses to incidents by communities of technical&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;experts, the response also had a political dimension. The activities by politicians&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;has had little, if any effect on the effective technical response by the Estonian and&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;global Internet security community. The Estonian and Western policy sphere&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;mainly responded with finger pointing at Russian authorities and a series of blame&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;games and diplomatic arm wrestling. It was not and has never been proved that&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Russian authorities were involved in the attacks, and, if so, at which level. But the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;high-level political response signalled to those who might be considering Internet&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;bullying that they would have to face political consequences. Whether this has had&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;any impact on those who rented botnets for the DDoS attacks and engaged in&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;some targeted attacks is only speculative. Not speculative however, but inevitable,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;was the support of actors outside of Estonia in managing the incoming torrent of&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;malicious packets.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Before proceeding with the description of events in Estonia in May 2007, a brief&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;introduction to CERT communities is required. Computer Emergency Response&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Teams (CERTs) or Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) function&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;as operational units to support individuals and organisations to adequately&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;respond to a security attack.&lt;span class="s1"&gt;79 &lt;/span&gt;Such CSIRTs are set up by large corporations or&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;political bodies willing to consolidate responses to security incidents, to establish&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;support centres for affected organisations or, in the case of corporate CSIRTs,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;organisational units. Different CSIRTs cover different organisations, sectors, regions,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;and countries. Their communicational cultures differ widely. While academic&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;CSIRTs are accessible and communicative, staff of military CSIRTs have&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;generally shied away from answering non-small-talk questions, let alone taking&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;part in research interviews. Many CSIRTs are publicly funded organisations, or&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;rather teams in publicly funded organisations.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;CSIRTs themselves build communities via umbrella organisations. The Forum of&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is probably the institution with&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;the widest geographical reach among them. FIRST serves as a hub for more than&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;210 CSIRTs worldwide, hosting an annual conference in different locations&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;around the globe that attract several hundreds, if not thousands, of participants&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;every year.&lt;span class="s1"&gt;80 &lt;/span&gt;Next to information exchange by presentations, networking is among&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;the key goals of FIRST&amp;rsquo;S annual conference.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you do the organization for an event like this, you specifically&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;look for hotels that have a lot of chairs, where 2, 3, or 4 people can sit&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;together and work on a problem.&amp;rdquo; (Interview 43)&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Security communities are not purely virtual communities, they also rely on personal&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;meetings.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Already in the 1990s, there were plans to establish a dedicated European CERT,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;code-named EUROCERT. However, interests of European states proved to be&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;too diverse to pool their response activities in one continent-wide body. Despite&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;the loud fanfares from Brussels politicians, the recently established EU-CERT&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;merely serves as the response team for the EU bureaucracy. After the EUROCERT&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;plans ran aground, the Amsterdam-based Trans-European Research and&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Education Networking Association (TERENA) set up a CSIRT task force (TFCSIRT).&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;81 &lt;/span&gt;Until today, TERENA and its TF-CSIRT serve as a mentor for the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;establishment of new CSIRTs and as a hub for CSIRTs to establish collaborative&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;networks with their European colleagues. Its Trusted Introducer programme liaises&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;new CSIRTs and their staff to the established CSIRTs, warrants the trustworthiness&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;of a CSIRT with its accreditation programme. The frequent TF-CSIRT&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;meetings create networking opportunities. In general, the purpose of TF-CSIRT&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;has been to facilitate networking among European response teams that allow them&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;to exchange ideas, information and issue requests for assistance in non-binding&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;ways. Within this network of European CSIRTs, governmental CERTs gather in&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;their very own &amp;ldquo;close-knit group&amp;rdquo; (Interview 82). Likewise, CERTs with similar&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;constituencies tend to have their own communities (Interview 14).&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;By early May 2007, the Estonian security experts had not yet developed deep trust&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;relationships with global security communities, which so frequently dealt with&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;large-scale DDoS attacks on the Internet. This omission required a belated correction&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;given the necessity for global collaboration, which translates to the exchange&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;of potentially delicate data and the cutting off pf users in the domain of Internet&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;security. The Estonians first created a bridge to their peers in European CERTs.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The head of CERT EE flew to Prague to attend the 21st TF-CSIRT meeting in&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Prague on &amp;mdash; lucky timing &amp;mdash; May 3-4 to raise the attention of the European&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;CERT community.&lt;span class="s1"&gt;82 &lt;/span&gt;Aarelaid gave a brief presentation at the closed Trusted Introducer&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;meeting on the first day about what was going on in Estonia and how the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;European CERT community could support the Estonians.&lt;span class="s1"&gt;83 &lt;/span&gt;Trusted Introducer is&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;a programme of TF-CSIRT to accredit CERTs and CSIRTs. CERT EE, which&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;was in operation only for a good year, had not yet run through all the steps required&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;to get accredited. But given the circumstances, Aarelaid could attend the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;closed session and give an account of the incident, its effects and likely causes (Interview&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;14). Even if participants had no direct control over network devices,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;CERTs&amp;rsquo; staff usually have close connections to upstream providers or regular ISPs,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;both of which are helpful in an anti-DDoS response.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Lucky conference timing came to the rescue a second time. The cooperation between&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;the international and the Estonian communities was significantly eased by a&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;long-planned RIPE meeting in Tallinn on May 7.&lt;span class="s1"&gt;84 &lt;/span&gt;It was during this RIPE meeting&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;that members of the Estonian technical community were eventually introduced&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;to members of the global Internet security community and gauged as trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;However, for this to happen, many gallons of kerosene had to be burned. In January&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;2007, Aarelaid flew to Seattle to attend a closed meeting of &amp;ldquo;one of those security&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;operational trust groups&amp;rdquo; hosted by Microsoft in January 2007 (Interview 69).&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;One of the anti-botnet vanguards apparently paved the way for him to get to that&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;meeting:&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the conferences they [the Internet Security Operations community]&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;ran was hosted by Microsoft. Hillar sent me a message that he&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;wanted to come, an email. And for me, Estonia was this place in Eastern&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Europe where all this cybercrime was coming from. And I didn't&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;know what to do with it. I thought it was a joke. Some cybercriminal&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;trying to come to the conference. But I decided to take a risk and I&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;brought Hillar there.&amp;rdquo; (Interview 15)&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;At this meeting in Seattle, Aarelaid met a person that would happen to attend the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;RIPE meeting in Tallinn and eventually be decisive in closing the gap in the networks&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;of security experts.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;He actually called me and said that [he wanted to ask me for] a favour.&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;[whether I could] do introductions for him because he hadn't&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;yet been formally vetted into an operational security group. &amp;hellip; [H]e was&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;trying, he was in the midst of getting vetted, but he wasn't yet. &amp;hellip; And&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;so I made the introductions&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;This &amp;ldquo;trusted intermediary&amp;rdquo; introduced Aarelaid to two experts who had key roles&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;in the community of network operations, and long-standing international industry&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;experience. With access to these persons, the Estonian community gained support&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;for Estonia&amp;rsquo;s important upstream providers and could move the packet blockade&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;further away from their systems (Interview 69; Interview 23; Interview 65). The&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;RIPE meeting on Monday, May 7, was both the perfect and the last opportunity&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;to bridge this gap in the informal response networks in an informal environment.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;With this newly achieved status as members of the technical community, a few&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Estonians could now send requests or lists with attacking IP addresses to mailinglist-&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;based security communities such as NSP-Sec.&lt;span class="s1"&gt;85 &lt;/span&gt;Network security professionals&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;around the world that are members of such a list would then help to stop malicious&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;traffic from flowing from their networks towards Estonian systems.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Other security services&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;The production of Internet security in the Estonian case consisted of a successful&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;mitigation of a mix of DDoS attacks, web defacements, and other malicious hacking&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;attempts. This overall service can best be separated into five distinct services&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;delivered by various Estonian and international actors. Situational awareness was&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;established by the monitoring of technical and social networks. DDoS mitigation&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;helped to minimize the impact of the main attack technique used against Estonian&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;systems. These were the two main components of the Estonian response. Others&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;included policing, malware analysis, and the somewhat vague category of information&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;sharing and distribution. The main technical defence approach was presented&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;earlier in section 5.1.3. This section discusses situational awareness,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;distribution of information, policing, and malware analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Given the state of technology in spring 2007, responding to DDoS attacks on several&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;organisations required data sharing among these organisations or their ICT&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;providers. In Estonia, no central monitoring system existed that would have kept&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;an eye on the health of Estonian web-based services. Individual organisations&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;monitored their systems, security and AV service providers their clients&amp;rsquo; systems,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;but the countrywide state was not directly displayed on the monitors of some security&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;professionals in Estonia. But there were workarounds. The IRC rooms used by&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;the Estonian security community served as an improvised monitoring system that&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;displayed problems with certain segments of the network. When two or more&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;members from one organisation dropped out at the same time, then their networks&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;likely had an issue (Interview 87). Most importantly however, security experts&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;shared their knowledge with their peers in the Estonian community, achieving&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;sufficient situational knowledge in the absence of central monitoring. As with&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;DDoS mitigation, larger Estonian organisations and especially ISPs had their network&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;monitoring systems in place (Interview 82). Their picture was complemented&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;by the global community, where major ISPs with &amp;ldquo;global outreach have a very good&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;visibility on DDoS activity.&amp;rdquo; (Interview 82) When the attacks started and new&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;events occurred during the almost-four-week period, peers in the response com&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;munity were briefed rapidly. At some point, the response community agreed on&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;cancelling their established reporting mechanism, which required any organisation&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;to formally report an incident to the national CERT (Interview 87). The absence&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;of written documents is certainly detrimental for historians and public managers&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;who want to give an account of past events or review the performance of their Internet&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;security institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;A second aspect of situational awareness refers to a knowledge of the activities of&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;potential perpetrators. Russian underground fora are monitored by commercial&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;security service providers, individual researchers, and presumably some governmental&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;agencies as well. These fora are places where hackers, carders, botherders, malware&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;authors and persons with other roles in the digital crime scene convene and&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;collaborate (Interview 73).&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dozens, if not hundreds &amp;mdash; every single underground forum is monitored&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;by a big number of people data-mining.&amp;rdquo; (Interview 73)&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Information about potential backers of the Estonian attacks was shared within the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Estonian community.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Furthermore, security teams and CERTs also need to stay on top of the news&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;stream on the latest current security issues. They keep an eye on a substantial number&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;of news sources and observe various sources that collect &amp;ldquo;badness information&amp;rdquo;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;87&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;like Clean mx, Spam Cops, Spamhouse, T-Shield, Abuse Helper, and other trackers.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;A national CERT can normalize and sanitize such information and send it to&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;their constituency.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Conveying lists of attacking systems from the attackee to networks closer to the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;attackers has been an important element in the Estonian response. Within Estonia,&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;the communication channels of the local security communities were used. For&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;trans-border communication, CERT communities or mailing lists like NSP-Sec&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;helped to convey information. ISPs were also contacted directly or via their respective&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;national CERT (Interview 82). National CERTs often act as intermediaries to&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;convey or receive information on behalf of their constituency, especially when affected&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;organisations do not have direct access to these communities via an employee-&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;member. In the Estonian case, the Finnish CERT FI supported their Estonian&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;counterpart by preparing lists for the international community. Estonian organisations&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;send lists of suspicious IP addresses to CERT EE, which then &amp;ldquo;semi-&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;automatically produced this lists of attackers&amp;rdquo; (Interview 87). This consolidated list&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;was then sent to CERT FI, which took care of international distribution (Interview&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;87). Eventually, the CERT FI was attacked, too, and busy defending itself, so&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;that the Estonian CERT then lost its most staunch supporter. Luckily, the attacks&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;had already passed their nadir, so it &amp;ldquo;was not a big problem&amp;rdquo; (Interview 87). CERT&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;EE took CERT FI&amp;rsquo;s automation scripts and managed to accomplish the task of&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;information distribution itself.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;A fundamental aspect of security production in general is policing, an aspect that&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;had been ignored by technical Internet security communities in very early years. In&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;constitutional states, sanctioning actors for malevolent activities is transferred to&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;the state&amp;rsquo;s legal system. Beyond and besides, social systems usually have their own&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;mechanisms to sanction activities that are unwanted by parts of the population.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Policing and sanctioning on the Internet has been made somewhat difficult by the&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;attribution problem. Proving that an unlawful activity has been committed by a&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;certain person is difficult when a perpetrator applies sophisticated anonymisation&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;and camouflage techniques. Estonian police arrested an Estonian schoolboy who&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;committed some very basic manual attacks, but actually only played a marginal&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;role. Nonetheless, he was the only one arrested for involvement in the Estonian&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;incident. Requests for investigative assistance to Russian authorities bore no fruits.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
